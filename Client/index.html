                This website has been designed to encode and encrypt messages into a file format that will be woven into cloth.  The message you submit through this website will be stored in its encrypted format in our database until it is ultimately woven into one collective textile with all the messages submitted over the course of this exhibition.  As a token of our gratitude for your contribution, you will be provided with a paper copy of your encrypted message along with its decryption key through the receipt printer on display here in the museum.<br /><br />Encrypted_Archive_03.fff is a fabric file format that contains 19 discrete digital files.  These digital files have been encoded into binary, encrypted and woven into the 50 yard cloth presently on display.  Each of the 19 files embedded in this cloth has a unique private key number that is necessary to decrypt and open the original file.  These private key numbers exist as morse code in the flashing neon lights.<br /><br />The .fff file format reimagines how digital files might be stored in plain sight through analog technology using the binary nature of weaving as a means of storing data inside the structures of a cloth.  These fabric files can hold texts, images, audio, video, or any other digital file format.  Such files could be used to transfer information across borders, storing data over time in a manner that is not readily available through digital means. This project questions the importance of privacy and the function of encryption in today’s Orwellian reality of digital surveillance, as well as how and why we store our data.
