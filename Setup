Heroku commands help document. This is critical to setup and remember Heroku related commands. The thing where Heroku files are hosted is called a dyno. It has an ephemeral memory, which means that it keeps recyling all the files at some unknown frequency. That's why it doesn't support any active file storage. In order to store entries typed into the Encryption Archive website, I have setup a SQL database provisioned by postgreSQL. 

Maximum entries supported in the hobby dev plan is 10,000 entries. At any time the storage will get close to full, we can just change the plan and that will increase the capacity of the database. 

Move to store-server folder to execute any heroku commands. 

- Push new changes to the heroku branch (From Store-Server folder)
git add . 
git commit 
git push heroku master

Then go back to the room and push the change to the the main git repository

- See the web url where the app can be accessed
heroku apps:info

- Connect to the heroku node
heroku run bash
---- let it connect ----
'ls' to see the current directory structure

Integrate heroku commands. 

Really helpful Heroku tutorial.

// LOCAL Database Access
Database on the cloud is cloned as localdb for now locally.

To test the SQL db locally, update the DATABASE_URL like this. 
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/localdb

To locally connect to the database:
psql -d localdb -U amaykataria

See all the values in the table. Table name is 'entries'
SELECT * FROM entries 

// See continuously flowing logs.
heroku logs --tail

// Open the web app that the node.js server is serving.
heroku open

// Accessing Datbase through my heroku directory
heroku pg:psql

Seeing the table - /dt

// Deleting an entry with a specific key'
DELETE FROM entries WHERE key LIKE '%<actualkey>%';

// DELETE ALL THE CONTENT FROM A Table
DELETE FROM entries; 

// POSTGRESQL amazing tutorial to create a db, setup a table, add entries, delete entries, and read entries.

Creating a new local database using psql (assuming it's installed on the computer)
createdb <tablename>; createdb mumimsafe
CREATE TABLE account(
	user_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
	username VARCHAR (50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
	password VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
	email VARCHAR (355) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
	created_on TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
	last_login TIMESTAMP
);
(follow the same steps to create the table on Heroku)

Local database for this project
psql mumimsafe_dev
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/mumimsafe_dev
Table name is entries (date, time, message)
SELECT * FROM entries;  (to see all the entries)
DELETE FROM entries; (to delete all the entries)

Heroku is deployed at https://blooming-refuge-71111.herokuapp.com

Postgres database is created at postgresql-lively-46522
To connet directly to that db: export DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgresql-lively-46522
heroku pg:psql to get into the database and check the table. 
heroku pg:info to find information about the database. 


Printer Changes Left:
- Grey out buttons after clicking until print is complete.
- Add sound.
- Make it responsive for all the screen sizes.
- Add a hook from Webserver to print consequently.

Capture and Download db (Need to do it from Central->Server) since there the credentials are stored. 
heroku pg:backups:capture
heroku pg:backups:download

Restoring a Database onto the Local db
pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -d mumimsafe_dev backup.2020.06.14

DELETE FROM entries WHERE time = '%15:06:42%'
